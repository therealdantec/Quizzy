# Quizzy
This is a Kahoot-Like game made from scratch for a class project. When running the program using "python3 app.py" in the terminal, the "teacher" is able to create an account, create quizzes, and host quizzes, and the "students" are able to join the quizzes, while on the same network, and participate in the quizzes, as done in Kahoot.
