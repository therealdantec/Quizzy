# Quizzy
Quizzy is a web-based application that allows users to participate in real-time, multiplayer quizzes, similar to Kahoot. It features a user registration and login system, a lobby system for joining quizzes, and a leaderboard to display top performers.
The application provides a quiz history feature, where users can review their past quizzes, see the questions they answered, whether their answers were correct or incorrect, and their score for each quiz.
The project uses a tech stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, Flask and Flask-SocketIO for the backend, and Jinja2 for templating. It's designed to run on a local network, allowing users on the same network to participate in quizzes.
